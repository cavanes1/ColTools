# ColTools
This is a set of codes that work for any molecule while using COLUMBUS.

## Linear synchronous transit
Generates a linear path between two geometries in internal coordinates (specifically, those automatically generated by intc.x).

### lst.py
Performs linear synchronous transit one point at a time, carrying over the previous MCSCF molecular orbital coefficients to each subsequent geometry.
Requires script.sh to launch

### simul.py
Performs linear synchronous transit by calculating all points of the path simultaneously.

### runcol.py
Resubmits jobs for all directories using the settings of a single directory. One can expect to use this to run MRCI after having used lst.py to run MCSCF.

## Line integral test
Performs a circular loop integral of the derivative coupling.
The code is divided into two parts, linA.py and linB.py.
linA.py generates the points and runs jobs for them, whereas linB.py extracts and analyzes the resulting data after the calculations complete.

### linA.py
Only the directory with the conical intersection search is required (and also linA.py). However, it is important to perform COLUMBUS input for nadcoupl.

### linB.py
A value of pi indicates a conical intersection (or an odd number in the loop) whereas a value of zero indicates a lack thereof (or an even number).
16 points should give 3.14, 8 points should give 3.
