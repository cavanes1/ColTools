# MethylamineStretcher

This code is similar to MethanethiolStretcher, but is used to study methylamine (CH3NH2) instead of methanethiol (CH3SH).

This code is used only to run tests, and not to generate new data for publication.



This respository is used to run calculations of methylamine geometries where the C-N bond is altered from equilibrium.

It can run an initial point with SCF and MCSCF, and then run adjacent points using the orbitals of the previous point as a starting point.

It can also run SCF at each geometry before MCSCF.

Note that files ending in 2 generate geometries in the same fashion as MethanethiolStretcher.
